    "### Limitations on File Formats for Images as Markers in Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "When using images or photos as markers in Matplotlib, there are some limitations and considerations regarding the file formats that can be used. Matplotlib supports a variety of image formats, but the compatibility and features may vary depending on the backend and specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supported File Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib supports several common image file formats, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   PNG: Portable Network Graphics\n",
    "*   JPG/JPEG: Joint Photographic Experts Group\n",
    "*   SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics\n",
    "*   PDF: Portable Document Format\n",
    "*   TIFF: Tagged Image File Format\n",
    "*   EPS: Encapsulated PostScript\n",
    "*   PS: PostScript\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points to Consider\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Backend Dependency: The available output formats depend on the backend being used. For example, the default \"Agg\" backend supports PNG, while the \"pdf\" backend supports PDF files.\n",
    "2.  Metadata Support: Some formats support embedding metadata, while others do not. For example, PNG and PDF support metadata, but formats like JPG and TIFF may have limited support.\n",
    "3.  Quality and Compression: Different formats have different compression methods and quality settings. PNG uses lossless compression, while JPG uses lossy compression, which can introduce artifacts.\n",
    "4.  Vector vs. Raster: Formats like SVG and PDF are vector-based and can scale without losing quality, while formats like PNG and JPG are raster-based and may lose quality when scaled.\n",
    "\n",
