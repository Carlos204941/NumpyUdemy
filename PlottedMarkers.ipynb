    "Yes, it is possible to add markers to the plotted data points in Matplotlib. Markers can be used to highlight individual data points on a plot, making the graph more informative and visually appealing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points to Consider\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Marker Styles: Matplotlib provides a variety of marker styles such as circles, squares, triangles, and more.\n",
    "2.  Customization: You can customize the size, color, and edge style of the markers.\n",
    "3.  Usage: Markers can be added to both line plots and scatter plots.\n",

    "### Basic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a simple example where we add markers to a line plot."
